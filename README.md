# OpenFoam-DarcySolver
This is an OpenFoam Solver to solve the Darcy Equation for Velocity and Pressure 
This is inspired & guided from the tutorial of "Introduction to open-source computational fluid dynamics using OpenFOAMÂ®" by Cyprien Soulaine
technology.

The Solver in a homogenous Porous Meduim is Darcy Foam.

The Solver for a hetrogenous Porous Meduim is Hetrogenous Darcy Foam

Results of Darcy Foam Solver : 

![Initial Condition at T=0](darcyFoam/Results/Initial_setup.png) Initail Condition for darcyFoam
![Fina ](darcyFoam/Results/pressure_feild.png)Pressure Feild for darcyFoam

Results of Hetrogenous Darcy Foam Solver:
